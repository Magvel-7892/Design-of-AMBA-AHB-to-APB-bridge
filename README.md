# Design-of-AHB-to-APB-bridge-using-verilog-HDL

This project deals with the design of AHB to APB bridge using Verilog HDL. Icacrus verilog simultion tool was used to simulate the design. A basic verilog testbench was created to verify the design for single read, single write, increment and wrap transfers.
